What is a 'W-9 Form'
A W-9 form is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form, also known as a Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification form, which is used to confirm a person’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). This confirmation can be requested for either an individual defined as a U.S. citizen or a person defined as a resident alien.

BREAKING DOWN 'W-9 Form'
A W-9 form is a formal written request for information only, and is used solely for the purpose of confirming a person’s TIN. An entity that is required to file an informational document with the IRS, such as a 1099, must obtain your correct TIN to report any earnings or losses that may affect your federal tax return or your taxable income.
The W-9 differs from a W-4, which is more commonly supplied by employees to direct employers, in that the W-9 does not inherently arrange for the withholding of any taxes due. Any required taxes based on gains related to the provided W-9 are the responsibility of the TIN holder listed on the document, unless the taxpayer is subject to backup withholding. If backup withholding is required, this will need to be noted on the W-9, to properly inform the entity receiving the information of the need to withhold accordingly.
